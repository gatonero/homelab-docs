# Service Model

The service model defines how services are described, categorized, and managed consistently.

It ensures comparability and reduces ambiguity across the service landscape.

---

## Core Attributes

Each service is described using the following attributes:

- Purpose
- Service type
- Dependencies
- Exposure (internal / external)
- Operational criticality
- Monitoring and alerting
- Backup and recovery relevance

Missing attributes indicate incomplete documentation.

---

## Service Types

Services are classified into:

- Infrastructure services
- Platform services
- Application services

The classification reflects operational impact, not implementation details.

---

## Dependencies

Dependencies must be explicit and directional.

Implicit dependencies are considered operational risks.

---

## Lifecycle Integration

Every service follows the defined lifecycle:

- Introduction
- Operation
- Change
- Decommissioning

Services outside the lifecycle are not acceptable.
