# Services Overview

This section documents all services operated within the Homelab.

Services are the functional layer built on top of the underlying architecture and operated according to the principles defined in the Operations documentation.

---

## Scope

The Services documentation covers:

- Infrastructure services
- Platform services
- Application services

Each service is documented individually, but all follow a consistent model.

---

## Service Characteristics

Every service is expected to have:

- A clearly defined purpose
- Known dependencies
- Defined operational boundaries
- Monitoring and alerting
- Backup and recovery considerations

Undocumented services are considered unmanaged.

---

## Relationship to Architecture and Operations

Architecture defines **what exists**.  
Operations define **how it is run**.  
Services define **what functionality is provided**.

This section focuses exclusively on the service perspective.

---

## Intended Audience

This documentation is written for:

- The operator of the Homelab
- Technical substitutes
- Future reconstruction or audit scenarios

Marketing language is intentionally avoided.
