# Emergency Recovery

Emergency recovery describes the immediate actions required to restore minimal operational capability after a severe disruption.

The focus is on **restoring function**, not on root cause analysis.

---

## Scope

Emergency recovery applies to situations such as:

- Complete host failures
- Loss of critical services
- Corrupted system state
- Unplanned extended outages

These situations require fast, decisive action.

---

## Recovery Objectives

The primary objectives are:

- Restore core services
- Re-establish monitoring and visibility
- Prevent further damage
- Stabilize the environment

Non-essential services are deferred.

---

## Order of Operations

Emergency recovery follows a strict order:

1. Restore infrastructure reachability
2. Restore identity and access where required
3. Restore core platform services
4. Restore dependent services
5. Re-enable monitoring and alerting

Deviation increases recovery risk.

---

## Documentation During Recovery

During emergency recovery:

- Actions are logged minimally
- Decisions are noted briefly
- Full documentation is deferred

Completeness is restored after stabilization.
