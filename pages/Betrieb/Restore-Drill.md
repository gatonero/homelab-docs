# Restore Drill

Restore drills are controlled exercises to validate backup and recovery capabilities.

They are performed proactively, not during incidents.

---

## Purpose of Drills

Restore drills serve to:

- Verify backup usability
- Validate documented procedures
- Identify gaps in recovery paths
- Build operational confidence

A restore that has never been tested is considered unreliable.

---

## Drill Execution

A restore drill follows these steps:

1. Select a defined restore scenario
2. Prepare an isolated test environment
3. Execute the restore procedure
4. Verify functional correctness
5. Document findings if relevant

---

## Frequency

Restore drills are performed periodically or after significant changes.

Frequency is chosen to balance confidence and operational effort.

---

## Outcomes

If a restore drill fails:

- The backup is considered invalid
- The procedure is corrected
- The drill is repeated

Unverified backups are not trusted.
