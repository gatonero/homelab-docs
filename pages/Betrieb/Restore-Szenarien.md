# Restore Scenarios

Restore scenarios describe expected recovery situations and the corresponding operational responses.

They exist to reduce decision-making under pressure.

---

## Typical Scenarios

Common restore scenarios include:

- Accidental data deletion
- Service misconfiguration
- Virtual machine corruption
- Host-level failures

Each scenario has a defined recovery path.

---

## Scope of Restore

Restore operations may target:

- Individual files
- Application data
- Complete virtual machines
- Entire hosts

The chosen scope depends on impact and recovery time objectives.

---

## Preconditions

Before initiating a restore:

- The incident is identified
- The restore scope is defined
- The target system is prepared
- Backup integrity is verified

Skipping preconditions increases recovery risk.
