# Maintenance and Changes

Maintenance ensures that systems remain secure, stable, and supportable.

Changes are treated as controlled operational events.

---

## Maintenance Principles

Maintenance activities follow these principles:

- Prefer automation over manual work
- Minimize service disruption
- Maintain rollback capability
- Verify outcomes explicitly

Unverified maintenance is considered incomplete.

---

## Types of Maintenance

Typical maintenance includes:

- Security updates
- Dependency upgrades
- Configuration adjustments
- Resource optimization

Each maintenance activity has a defined scope.

---

## Change Handling

All changes must:

- Be planned
- Be documented
- Be executed deliberately
- Be verified after completion

Emergency changes are documented retroactively.

---

## Post-Change Verification

After any change:

- System health is verified
- Monitoring signals are checked
- Unexpected side effects are investigated

A change is not complete until verification succeeds.
