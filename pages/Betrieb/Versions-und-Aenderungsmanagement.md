# Version and Change Management

Version and change management provide traceability and control over system evolution.

They ensure that the current state can always be explained and reconstructed.

---

## Version Control

All relevant artifacts are version-controlled, including:

- Configuration files
- Automation code
- Documentation

Unversioned operational artifacts are not acceptable.

---

## Change Tracking

Every change must be traceable to:

- A documented intention
- A version control commit
- A known operational context

Changes without context are considered risk factors.

---

## Rollback Capability

Where possible, rollback paths are defined in advance.

If rollback is not possible, the risk is explicitly acknowledged.

---

## Operational Transparency

The system state must be explainable at any point in time.

Version history is a core operational asset, not an administrative detail.
