# Services – Overview

This document provides an overview of the services operated within the homelab.

It acts as an entry point for service-specific documentation and operational context.

---

## Purpose

The services documentation exists to:

* describe available functionality
* document service exposure and dependencies
* provide orientation for operations and troubleshooting

It focuses on structure and intent, not detailed setup instructions.

---

## Service Categories

Services are grouped into the following categories:

* **Infrastructure services** – foundational components such as DNS, Reverse Proxy, monitoring
* **Platform services** – virtualization and container platforms
* **Application services** – user-facing applications

Each category has dedicated documentation.

---

## Documentation Rules

For each service:

* the purpose is clearly described
* access paths (DNS, ports, TLS) are documented
* dependencies are explicitly stated

All services are also registered in NetBox.

---

## Lifecycle

* Services are documented before deployment
* Changes are reflected immediately
* Retired services are removed or archived

Undocumented services are considered out of policy.

---

## Relationship to Other Documentation

* Architecture documents define constraints
* Operational documents define procedures
* NetBox provides the authoritative inventory

This document provides orientation across all services.
