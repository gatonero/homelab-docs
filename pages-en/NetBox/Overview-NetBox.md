# NetBox - Overview

← Back to the [Homelab Overview](../00-Overview-Homelab.md)

Central overview of the use of NetBox as the source for inventory,
structure, and technical documentation of the homelab.

## Purpose
This page describes the role of NetBox as the central,
structured data source for the homelab. NetBox serves as the
single source of truth for systems, networks, services, and
relationships between these objects.

Documentation and operations are consistently aligned with the
information maintained in NetBox.

## Areas of Use
NetBox is used in the homelab, among other things, for:

- Inventory of hosts, virtual machines, and containers
- Documentation of networks, IP addresses, and VLANs
- Representation of roles, dependencies, and relationships
- Support of documentation and operational processes

## Core Principles
The use of NetBox follows a set of clear guidelines:

- NetBox is the canonical data source
- Documentation references NetBox, not the other way around
- Infrastructure changes are recorded in NetBox first
- Consistency and currency take precedence over completeness

## Scope
This page does not contain detailed operating instructions.
