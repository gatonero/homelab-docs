## Purpose
Conveys the architecture model and its central goals,
independent of specific implementations.

---
## Architecture Goals
- Stable and traceable operation
- Controlled complexity
- Maintainability and recoverability
- Extensibility without structural breaks

---
## System Layers
- Physical layer (hardware, cabling)
- Platform layer (virtualization, containers)
- Service layer (services, applications)
- Management layer (control, documentation, operations)

---
## Scope
No meta feedback loops to operations or governance.
