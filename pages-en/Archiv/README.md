# Archive

This section contains archived documentation.

Archived documents describe:

* deprecated approaches
* historical configurations
* superseded decisions

They are preserved for reference, traceability, and historical context.

---

## Purpose of the Archive

The archive exists to:

* retain knowledge about past decisions
* avoid repeating previously rejected approaches
* provide context for the current target state

Archived documents are **not** part of the active operational documentation.

---

## Usage Rules

* Archived documents must not be used as operational guidance
* They are clearly marked as deprecated or historical
* References from active documentation are avoided

If an archived concept becomes relevant again, it must be re-evaluated and documented anew.

---

## Structure

The archive mirrors the structure of the active documentation where applicable.

Each archived document should clearly state:

* why it was archived
* when it was deprecated
* what replaced it, if applicable
