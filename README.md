# Homelab Documentation

This repository contains the complete technical documentation of a privately operated Homelab.

The documentation is written with an explicit focus on:
- architectural clarity
- operational robustness
- long-term maintainability
- reproducibility without implicit assumptions

It is **not** a tutorial collection and **not** a marketing description.
It reflects the **actual, intentionally built system**.

---

## What to expect

The documentation covers, among others:

- overall architecture and system design
- operational principles and procedures
- infrastructure and application services
- networking, DNS, and TLS concepts
- monitoring, backup, and recovery
- governance, security, and documentation rules

The structure is optimized for:
- later reconstruction
- external review
- methodical operation over time

---

## Documentation languages

The documentation exists in two languages.

German is the **leading and authoritative language**.
All content is created and maintained there first.
The English version is a direct translation.
