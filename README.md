The focus is on architecture, networking, services, and operations, with an emphasis
on clarity, reproducibility, and long-term maintainability. The documentation applies
production-style thinking to a homelab environment.

## Documentation Languages

The documentation is available in two languages:

- 🇩🇪 **German documentation:** `pages/`
- 🇬🇧 **English documentation:** `pages-en/`

The English documentation is a complete translation of the German original and follows
the same structure and conventions.

## Scope

The documentation covers:

- overall architecture and design principles
- networking, DNS, TLS, and access models
- virtualization and container platforms
- service documentation and onboarding
- backup, restore, and recovery procedures
- operational policies and drills
- NetBox as the central source of truth

## Intended Audience

It is not a step-by-step beginner tutorial.

It is intended to serve as:
- a technical reference
- a decision log
- a long-term knowledge base
