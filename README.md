# Homelab Documentation

This repository contains the documentation for a personal homelab environment.
It focuses on structure, architecture, and operational clarity rather than
step-by-step tutorials.

The documentation is intended to be read sequentially, starting from the
central overview.

## Scope and Intent

This documentation describes:
- architectural decisions and boundaries
- operational principles and responsibilities
- service roles and interactions
- governance and consistency rules

It does not aim to provide copy-and-paste configurations or
tool-specific how-to guides.

## Intended Audience

The content is written for technically experienced readers who:
- operate or design complex systems
- value explicit structure and clear responsibilities
- prefer reproducible and maintainable setups over ad-hoc solutions

## Use of AI Assistance

Parts of this documentation were developed with the support of AI-based tools.
AI was used strictly as an assistive instrument within a defined governance
framework.

Rules governing the use of AI assistance are documented within the governance
section of the documentation. All decisions, validations, and final wording
remain the responsibility of a human author.

## Status

This documentation represents a maintained and actively curated state.
Changes follow defined rules and are applied deliberately.
