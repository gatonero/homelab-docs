# Homelab Documentation

This repository contains a **conceptual, versioned documentation** of a personal homelab environment.

The focus is on **architecture, networking, services, operations, security, and governance**, with a strong emphasis on clarity, reproducibility, and long-term maintainability. The documentation applies **production-style thinking** to a homelab context.

---

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

- document the homelab as a **coherent system**, not a collection of tools
- make **architectural and operational decisions explicit and traceable**
- separate **principles and concepts** from concrete implementations
- provide a stable reference for **operation, change, and recovery**

This is not a quick-start guide. It is a **long-term reference**.

---

## Documentation Languages

The documentation is available in two languages:

- 🇩🇪 **German documentation:** `pages/`
- 🇬🇧 **English documentation:** `pages-en/`

The English documentation is a **complete translation** of the German original and follows the same structure, conventions, and conceptual boundaries.

---

## Structure

The documentation is organized into clearly separated layers:

- **Architecture** – structure, principles, dependencies, integration
- **Operations** – backup, restore, monitoring, lifecycle
- **Security** – access models, segmentation, secrets
- **Governance** – documentation rules, review processes, versioning
- **Inventory (NetBox)** – source of truth and relationships

Each layer builds on the previous ones.

---

## Guiding Principles

- Conceptual first, implementation second
- Stability over short-term optimization
- Explicit dependencies instead of implicit knowledge
- Documentation as part of operations
- Reproducibility and traceability

---

## Intended Audience

This documentation is written for **technically experienced ad**
